# 🎮 Video Game Management – Front End

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is the front-end of my **Video Game Management Application**, a responsive web app built with React. It allows users to:

- Search for video games
- View detailed game information
- Add games to their personal list
- Navigate through a clean, multi-page interface

The app uses **React Router** for dynamic routing and includes the following pages:

- **Home Page** – Displays the list of added games
- **Search Page** – Fetches and displays game results from the back end
- **Details Page** – Shows detailed information about a selected game
- **Not Found Page** – Handles routes that don't exist

The application is styled with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring responsiveness across mobile and desktop devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**
- **React Router**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **React Icons**

## 🧰 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
   git clone

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:  
   npm install

3. Start the development server:  
   npm run dev

⚠️ Important: Ensure the back-end server is also running so that API requests work properly. The application fetches data from the database and the IGDB API through the back end.

## 🧰 🌐 Live Demo

The front-end is deployed on Render.com:

⏳ Note: Since the app is hosted on Render’s free plan, there may be a short delay when loading data due to the back-end "waking up" from sleep mode.

## 📝 Notes

This project helped me learn how to:

- Build and deploy a front-end React application
- Work with RESTful APIs and handle CORS issues
- Style apps effectively using Tailwind CSS
- Deploy full-stack applications with hosting platforms

Big thanks to ChatGPT and various YouTube tutorials for helping me troubleshoot deployment and styling challenges. I found Tailwind CSS really helpful for speeding up UI development, and React Icons provided great-looking icons for elements like the search bar and delete button
